# Cross-UK-Gov Public Repository Leaderboard

[![Publisher](https://github.com/uk-x-gov-software-community/xgov-opensource-repo-scraper/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/uk-x-gov-software-community/xgov-opensource-repo-scraper/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This is a crude tool that scrapes [organisations that GitHub recognise to be UK central gov or UK councils](https://government.github.com/community/) and records some stats about that.

## Data

You can get the raw data in [json format](https://uk-x-gov-software-community.github.io/xgov-opensource-repo-scraper/repos.json) which is updated nightly via github actions


## Browse
Or you can navigate it via the [webpage](https://uk-x-gov-software-community.github.io/xgov-opensource-repo-scraper) (that loads this json)

## Explore
Or you can import the json dynamically into your favourite tool.
To demonstrate this I've created [a Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S4k63hpb2oLEUPva1N2iTNi-NsyRKLystYGKd6zuLII/edit?usp=sharing) for this
